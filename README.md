### Sequelize
Sequelize is a powerful Node.Js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, created with the aim to facilitate communication between javascript/typescript and SQL.

<ul>
<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<li>Model Definition: Define database models using JavaScript classes, making it easy to represent tables and relationships.</li>

<li>Querying: Sequelize offers a straightforward API for querying data, supporting raw queries, finders, filters, and associations.</li>

<li>Transactions: Easily manage transactions to ensure data integrity and consistency across multiple operations. </li>

<li>Migrations: Seamlessly update and rollback database schemas using migration files, keeping your database structure in sync with your application. </li>

<li>Associations: Define relationships between models such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many, and Sequelize handles foreign key constraints automatically.</li>

<li>Hooks and Validations: Implement hooks for lifecycle events like beforeCreate, afterUpdate, etc., and define validations for model attributes.</li>

<li>Support for Promises and async/await: Sequelize fully supports asynchronous operations, leveraging Promises and async/await syntax for cleaner, more readable code.</li>
